    <h1>Jolly days in Germany (September)</h1>
    <p>Preamble: I worked remotely, from the 1st until the 16th.</p>
    <h2>First stop (or start)... Ryanair flight</h2>
    <p>It was delayed but, in an amazing display of teamwork and ingenuity, they turned the plane around in seemingly 30
        minutes.
        Once in KÃ¶ln, I met a legend on the bus, called Sophie, with whom I chatted for the whole journey.</p>
    <h2>Day 1 (Day 0 was travel day, I hope this is ok)</h2>
    <p>The next day I worked in the morning and then headed for some local attractions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jesuitkirche</li>
        <li>Church of the Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>Uni Library</li>
        <li>Gelato Go</li>
        <li>Schloss</li>
        <li>Schitzelhaus - mit zitrone</li>
        <li>Alte BrÃ¼cke</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I then ventured back along Philosophie Weg before meeting three lovely groups:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Three gentlemen who just beckoned me over for a chat. They had moved to Heidelberg from Afghanistan and they told me about their lives and taught me a little German.</li>
        <li>An older man and a lady who teaches locally, with whom I chatted with at the <a href="https://neckarorte-heidelberg.de/">Neckarorte Strandbar RÃ¶merbad</a>, where live Latin music was playing.</li>
        <li>A group of local Bachata dancers/volleyball players, who I sang with, whilst guzzling a delightful rÃ¤dler.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then I headed back home and had a fun day working remotely and going shopping. I went to the Deutsch-Amerikanisches institut. 
        On Tuesday, I moved to Walldorf and settled into a regime of work, gym, German practice, shopping for food and exploration (plus sleep).
        I also met the lovely Global Sponsorship team :) I also had my first Brezel (5/5).

    <h2>My first weekend</h2>
    <p>I chatted with James on the Friday night and we finished Avatar: The Last Airbender. On Saturday, I did some work; chatted with Millie and Will; then, I played tennis with Karl-Heinz.
        On Sunday, I cycled around the town, went to a local concert in the park and played Tennis with Jula &ndash; the host's daughter, who lives in Heidelberg &ndash; and Chris, her boyfriend. At the concert,
        I tried Laugenstange (4/5), which a bread roll dipped in Lye, which is alkali. 
    </p>


    <h2>The <em>Chaos</em> begins (week 1 proper)</h2>
    <p>After meeting Axel and Lisa briefly, lots of the US team and Sinead from Ireland arrived and we headed to Lars' for a <strong>party</strong>!</p>
    <p>On the Tuesday, I made cookies and did a cheeky Joe Wicks workout. This week had a steep learning curve and so in the evenings I mainly practiced
        German and exercised. I did make a healthy Adam Ragusea soup though and took up an interest in the rowing machine. On Friday, I made this creamy, curry-powdered,
        vegetable dish before trying to catch some Zzzzzs.  
    </p>
    <p class="fun-fact"><em>Fun fact: </em>Magpies are able to solve puzzles mimic human speech and recognise themselves in the mirror. They use every chick in the book ;)</p>
    <h2>The beginning of the beginning</h2>
    <p>I didn't actually get to sleep, despite lying in bed for 2 hours ðŸ˜¢. However, I had spring in my step as I headed to the train station, which evaporated
       once I reached Heidelberg station and had to wait for 1.5 hours. After boarding the train, I chatted with this friendly gentleman, before clocking out, for an hour
       I awoke and our conversation resumed, until he departed. He did tell me about this river festival, in Ulms, called the Nabada: on this day, the river
       is full of inflatables! 
    </p>
    <h2>The beginning</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Izzi enters the train and kindly informs me she is in carriage 6.</li>
        <li>I tell her I am in carriage 2...</li>
        <li>She arrives in carriage 2........</li>
        <li>'Where are you?' I receive.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Turns out, I was in carriage 9 and I was in class 2, a label all carriages bear (except first class). Izzi was very understanding :) Anyhow, we meet on the platform; stash my rucksack in a local locker;
        and head for the sites!. We went to the Frauenkirche, Marienplatz, briefly the Theatine Church and, lastly, the Karlsplatz. 
        Next we grabbed a Brezen (3/5) and headed to the station, where we met Kira the legend, who provided Dirndl for Izzi.
