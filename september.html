    <h1>Jolly days in Germany (September)</h1>
    <p>Preamble: I worked remotely, from the 1st until the 16th.</p>
    <h2>First stop (or start)... Ryanair flight</h2>
    <p>It was delayed but, in an amazing display of teamwork and ingenuity, they turned the plane around in seemingly 30
        minutes.
        Once in K√∂ln, I met a legend on the bus, called Sophie, with whom I chatted for the whole journey.</p>
    <h2>Day 1 (Day 0 was travel day, I hope this is ok)</h2>
    <p>The next day I worked in the morning and then headed for some local attractions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jesuitkirche - 18th century white-washed Jesuit<sup>&dagger;</sup> church, adorned with lots of sculptures, many made of glass.</li>
        <li>Church of the Holy Spirit - a wonderful church with modern stained-glass windows (e.g. E=mc<sup>2</sup> window).</li>
        <li>Uni Library - a grand library, with a mini artefacts museum.</li>
        <li>Gelato Go - a small ice cream shop but with a big queue (if you catch my drift).</li>
        <li>Schloss - a wonderful sprawling castle and gardens. Due to conflicts and a lightning strikes the castle was damaged.
            and has only been partly reconstructed.
        </li>
        <li>Schitzelhaus - a great schnitzel bar where I had mine 'mit zitrone' (lemon).</li>
        <li>Alte Br√ºcke - the old bridge, with impressive gates on one side, and wonderful views all the way across.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&dagger; 'Jesuit' is the name for members of the Catholic, Society of Jesus.</p>
    <p>I then ventured back along Philosophie Weg before meeting three lovely groups:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Three gentlemen who just beckoned me over for a chat. They had moved to Heidelberg from Afghanistan and they told me about their lives and taught me a little German.</li>
        <li>An older man and a lady who teaches locally, with whom I chatted with at the <a href="https://neckarorte-heidelberg.de/">Neckarorte Strandbar R√∂merbad</a>, where live Latin music was playing.</li>
        <li>A group of local Bachata dancers/volleyball players, who I sang with, whilst guzzling a delightful Radler.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then I headed back home. The next day, I had a fun day working remotely, visiting the Botanical gardens and going shopping. I went to the Deutsch-Amerikanisches institut, where they hold a weekly
        global news/politics discussion group.
        On Tuesday, I moved to Walldorf and settled into a regime of work, gym, German practice, shopping for food and exploration (plus sleep).
        I also met the lovely Global Sponsorship team :) I also had my first Brezel (5/5).

    <h2>My first weekend</h2>
    <p>I chatted with James on the Friday night and we finished Avatar: The Last Airbender. On Saturday, I did some work; chatted with Millie and Will; then, I played tennis with Karl-Heinz (my friendly landlord/Vermieter).
        On Sunday, I cycled around the town, went to a local concert in the park and played Tennis with Jula &ndash; the host's daughter, who lives in Heidelberg &ndash; and Chris, her boyfriend. At the concert,
        I tried Laugenstange (4/5), which a bread roll dipped in Lye, which is alkali. 
    </p>


    <h2>The <em>Chaos</em> begins (week 1 proper)</h2>
    <p>After meeting Axel and Lisa briefly, lots of the US team and Sinead from Ireland arrived and we headed to Lars' for a <strong>party</strong>! We played lots of party games and
        had a lovely meal together (dessert was an amazing tiramisu). A great evening, where I met lots of the team, many whom I would
        sadly not see again over the course of the year.    
    </p>
    <p>On the Tuesday, I made cookies and did a cheeky Joe Wicks workout. This week had a steep learning curve and so in the evenings I mainly practiced
        German and exercised. I did make a healthy Adam Ragusea soup though and took up an interest in the rowing machine. On Friday, I made this creamy, curry-powdered,
        vegetable dish before trying to catch some Zzzzzs.  
    </p>

    <h2>The beginning of the beginning (of Oktoberfest)</h2>
    <p>I didn't actually get to sleep, despite lying in bed for 2 hours üò¢. However, I had a spring in my step, as I headed to the train station, which evaporated
       once I reached Heidelberg station and had to wait for 1.5 hours. After boarding the train, I chatted with this friendly gentleman, before clocking out, for an hour
       I awoke and our conversation resumed, until he departed. He did tell me about this river festival, in Ulms, called the Nabada: on this day, the river
       is full of inflatables! 
    </p>
    <img class="float-right" src="images/arrival.JPG" alt="Izzi and I in Tracht attire">
    <h2>The beginning</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Izzi enters the train and kindly informs me she is in carriage 6.</li>
        <li>I tell her I am in carriage 2...</li>
        <li>She arrives in carriage 2........</li>
        <li>'Where are you?' I receive.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Turns out, I was in carriage 9 and I was in class 2, a label all carriages bear (except first class). Izzi was very understanding :) Anyhow, we meet on the platform; stash my rucksack in a local locker;
        and head for the sites!. We went to the Frauenkirche, Marienplatz, briefly the Theatine Church and, lastly, the Karlsplatz. 
        Next we grabbed a Brezn (3/5) and headed to the station, where we met Kira the legend, who provided a Dirndl for Izzi.
    </p>
    
   
    
    <h2>The end of the beginning</h2>
    <div class="float-container">
        <img class="float-left" src="images/festzelt.JPG" alt="Bandstand with rotating beer Stein or Ma√ü">
    
        <p>We headed to the festival, through bustling streets, past smiling people, until we reached the Wiesn. We looked at the L√∂wenbr√§u-Festzelt
            (which had a cool rotating lion outside), which is a tent many Australians visit. As we looked around our jaws dropped a little, and then some more...
            And then dislocated in awe of the scale and opportunity. We wandered a little before heading to the Paulaner Festzelt, where we set about wrestling for seats in the <em>pens</em>.
            These were unreserved seats, that on a Saturday, filled up quickly. Luckily, thanks to Kira's negotiating skills and Izzi's martial arts, we
            secured a spot.
        </p>

    <h2>We obtain beer (the middle)</h2>

    <img class="medium-image" src="images/oktoberfest-gang.JPG" alt="Izzi, Kira, Riccardio and me, with our drinks, in Tracht">
    <p>We ordered a beer.... (at 10:20am üòÜ)</p>
    <h2>The beginning of the end</h2>
    <p>I had to distance myself from my beer as we took in the wonderful tents and surrounding revelry. In the middle was a brilliant band.
        Many people downed many drinks around us and our initial neighbours were more than a little flirty, at one point completely ceding
        their area for a group of bridesmaids. After a while though, the surrounding faces settled and we got chatting with Ricardio and his mates.
        He introduced a new drinking game, which mainly consisted of alcohol consumption at all opportunities. 
    </p>
    <h2>The end</h2>
    <p>
        We grabbed Pfannkuchensuppe and tried some Fasskraut (supposedly better Sauerkraut, from a jar). And our decline (especially mine)
        into inebreation continued üçª. 
        In the evening, we started dancing on the tables and were joined by some new faces, who were cool. We headed out at 9ish and grabbed
        Leberkn√∂delsuppe (dumpling soup) and Zwetschgenkn√∂del (mini prune dumplings). We then watched people "elegantly" attempt to ride the <strong>Toboboggan</strong>:
        a fast, uphill conveyor (the funny bit), followed by a helter skelter. 
        It was a wonderful day and my face ached from smiling as I headed to the Lost Souls campsite...
    </p>

    <h2>Sunday at Oktoberfest (technically October but I am placing it here for continuity)</h2>
    <p>I got up later and headed to meet the others at the station. This time we were joined by yet another legend: Lily.
        After a scrumptious Drehspie√ü H√§hnchen, we headed in for round 2. We were able to visit the gorgeous horses which draw the
         beer barrels and visit some other tents such as the traditional Augustiner and Hacker Zelts (tents), before settling in the 
         Armbrustsch√ºtzenzelt (crossbow themed tent). Another band sat in the middle, which played more traditional Bavarian tunes for more of the day.
         We were served at the tables by Kira's friend Anna and later Sebastian, as well as Kira's chums from Acrobatics.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We tried a big Brezn (4/5 &mdash; mainly due to generous size). And played some Arshloch (a bit like Emperor) with Bavarian cards.
        As the sun went down, we went up onto the benches. I knocked over a drink, which I will forever feel guilty about :( Met some
        lovely folks.

    <p>We headed to the Toboboggan, and rode it pretty much successfully, before heading to the station. We caught the same train,
        and I sadly had to part with my partners-in-crime :( 
    </p>
    <img class="medium-image" src="images/the-view.JPG" alt="View from helter skelter of the Wiesn">
    <p>I chatted with the person next to me on the train, who was from Sweden and spoke excellent German, who kindly supplied me with some
        <em>Setayesh</em> sweets and carrots üëç I made it home at 1:30 am after a sensational weekend. Thanks be to Izzi for inviting me and orchestrating the 
        weekend and to all those who made it so special ü§ó
