    <h1>Jolly days in Germany (September)</h1>
    <h2>First stop (or start)... Ryanair flight</h2>
    <p>It was delayed but, in an amazing display of teamwork and ingenuity, they turned the plane around in seemingly 30
        minutes.
        Once in Köln, I met a legend on the bus, called Sophie, with whom I chatted for the whole journey.</p>
    <h2>Day 1 (Day 0 was travel day, I hope this is ok)</h2>
    <p>The next day I worked in the morning and then headed for some local attractions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jesuitkirche</li>
        <li>Church of the Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>Uni Library</li>
        <li>Gelato Go</li>
        <li>Schloss</li>
        <li>Schitzelhaus - mit zitrone</li>
        <li>Alte Brücke</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I then ventured back along Philosophie Weg before meeting three lovely groups:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Three gentlemen who just beckoned me over for a chat. They had moved to Heidelberg from Afghanistan and they told me about their lives and taught me a little German.</li>
        <li>An older man and a lady who teaches locally, with whom I chatted with at the <a href="https://neckarorte-heidelberg.de/">Neckarorte Strandbar Römerbad</a>, where live Latin music was playing.</li>
        <li>A group of local Bachata dancers/volleyball players, who I sang with, whilst guzzling a delightful rädler.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then I headed back home and had a fun day working remotely and going shopping. I went to the Deutsch-Amerikanisches institut. 
        On Tuesday, I moved to Walldorf and settled into a regime of work, gym, German practice, shopping for food and exploration (plus sleep).
        I also met the lovely Global Sponsorship team :)
    </p>


    <h2>My first weekend</h2>
    <p>I chatted with James on the Friday night and we finished Avatar: The Last Airbender. On Saturday, I did some work; chatted with Millie and Will; then, I played tennis with Karl-Heinz.
        On Sunday, I cycled around the town and played Tennis with Jula &ndash; the host's daughter, who lives in Heidelberg &ndash; and Chris, her boyfriend.
    </p>


    <h2>The <em>Chaos</em> begins (week 1 proper)</h2>
    <p>After meeting Axel and Lisa briefly, lots of the US team and Sinead from Ireland arrived and we headed to Lars' for a <strong>party</strong>!</p>
