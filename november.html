    <title>Negligence in November</title>

<h1>What's going on</h1>
<p>I went for a nice long walk and listened to "What's Going On". James and I watched a few episodes of <em>Rick and Morty</em> and
    then I watched <em>A close shave</em> (Wallace and Grommit)! On Thursday, I went to the weekly HIT class and had a brilliant session: 
    I really pushed myself, as I was a little late, and felt ecstatic afterwards. 
</p>
<p>Later that day, I also watched <em>Coco</em> (I would recommended üëç) with Will, which was really nice.</p>
<p>On Friday, I had a fun call, working on the internal wiki, with Lisa. In the evening, Nico kindly invited me for dinner at "The Korean Restaurant" (an inventive name), with some of his college mates:
    Amelie, Anna and Olivia. Afterwards, we went to the Urban Kitchen, ordered cocktails (which came with a marshmellow!), and then
    played the "Am I?" game. We all tried to figure out which character or celebrity we were, based on yes-no questions. It was 
    a wonderful evening: I practiced my German, laughed a lot, met some great new people and, of course, caught up with Nico.
</p>
<p>On Saturday, after a healthy lie in :), I did a little work and then went shopping with Sruthi (as we planned to cook a meal). 
    Then, after waiting for a bus for ages, had to cycle to the Sankt Leon Rot Kerwe, with Nico and some of his elementary school mates.
    Google Maps let me down because it sent me down a path that became more and more boggy as I went, and less and less path-like, 
    <em>but</em> at such a slow rate, that by the time I considered retracing my steps... it was too late.  
</p>
<p>None the less, after the little mishap and a right turn after the infamous Daddy's Grill, I arrived at the Kerwe and united with the posse.
    We wandered and pondered, and then we ate üòã. Nico and I shared a Honey and Almond Schokokuss &mdash; a flavoured marshmellow, coated in chocolate &mdash;
    and we visited the music zones. Nico's mates headed off and after some more chatting, so did I. 
</p>
<p>However, the sky opened the flood gates. I raced through the biblical downpour, at time aquaplaning across the spirit-level-flat 
    paths. I took a slightly different route to avoid the swampish terrain but this longer route resulted in extra wetness. It was an adventure alright,
    and twenty minutes later, I arrived home, soaked to the bone. 
</p>
<p>After, indulging in a nice shower, I gave Dylan a ring and we had a nice catchup chat, as well as watching a little of 
    <em>Your Lie In April</em>.     
</p>
<p>On the Sunday, I had a lovely chat with Grandma, did some yoga, called Mum, went for a walk and then cooked Zwiebelkuchen 
    (literally onion cake) with my old housemate Sruthi and her new housemate Feng. It consists of a fluffy pizza-like base,
    with a creamy, eggy, onion and pepper topping. We made the dish together and played cards whilst it cooked. Later in the evening, I also discovered
    that my new room mate would be Lenard, a friend of Lisa's from the working-student scheme, whom I'd met the week before in the gym!
    To conclude the weekend, I went for a jog and then had a great birthday chat with Will.
</p>
<h2>Week 2!!</h2>
<p>
    I began the week in an unusual fashion: I awoke a whole hour earlier! I made my bed, brushed my teeth (thoroughly) and 
    screwed on my head. Then I headed in for a MongoDB (DB=database) workshop, where they had the creamiest coffee ever! Sadly, 
    the event didn't begin for almost an <em>hour</em>... And, once commencing, I quickly identified that the <em>lingua franca</em>
    was German. Nonetheless, it was interesting and insightful üòÅ 
</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to the weekly discussion group, where I was starting to get to know people. Afterwards, I made a Victoria
    Sponge for Petra, Karl-Heinz and Jula; the office team; a bit for the housemates; some for Sruthi; and some for me (it was pretty tin).
    Tuesday = Bachata! It was a great session, I got to try the difficult Salsa class and I even stayed a bit afterwards to practice Bachata.
    On the Wednesday, I went for a nice meal with Manuel (who also attends the discussion group). We initially struggled as we turned up 
    to "The" Flammkuchen restaurant without a booking. Instead, we went to a lovely Italian restaurant and surpassed our step goals for the day.
</p>
<p>On Thursday, I went to my HIT class and then chatted with mates on Discord. To wrap up the week, I had a busy, hard-working Friday
    and spent some time responding to audio messages (some German and some English).
</p>
<h2>Controlled chaos</h2>
<p>I had volunteered to help at the SAP badminton tournament and we had been briefed earlier in the week about what to do, as well as where
    help was needed: I would be on check-in first and then the Springer (stand-in/job-filler).
    So on Saturday morning, Johanna kindly gave me a lift and we began the setup.
