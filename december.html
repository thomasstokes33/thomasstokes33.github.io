<h1>Delightful Dezember!</h1>
<p>In the first week of December, I ate a lot of cabbage.. spicy cabbage, balsamic cabbage, spinach+onion (with cabbage), braised
    sweet cabbage, cabbage curry and cabbage soup (this was actually the first). The week was tough from a work perspective but 
    also engaging (especially when we put on Christmas music). However, I felt like I deserved the Friday night Gl√ºhwein: after work, Lisa and I rushed around trying to catch the first
    bus, and accidentally took a roundabout, but certainly adventurous, route (via the train station üòÇ). We rendezvoused at the local 
    Weihnachtsmarkt, which was well stocked with crafty gifts, delectable food, warm drinks. There was an excellent choir and hearty fire.     
</p>
<p> On the Saturday, I started work, with James, on some gifts, had a walk and went to <strong>yet again</strong> a Weihnachtsmarkt, 
    this time with the student community, to Heidelberg. I met some wonderful folks, as well as chatting more to Mark, and enjoyed the Christmas spectacle.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, I awoke and headed to the Christmas market. Just kidding ;) (that comes later.) I did some exercise and had a good family catchup
    And then I headed to the Christmas market with Lenard, Lisa, Sebastian, Can and Niklas (whom we baked cookied/Pl√§tzchen with). We were joined
    by Lenard and his partner Sofia. I later headed to play tennis (to warm up), with Karl-Heinz, Petra and Jula. Luckily, we moved to indoor courts,
    as opposed to the outdoor clay pitches, we had previously played on. We had some brilliant sets! An unusual, fun and fit way to end 
    the week.
</p>

<h2>Christmas tunes commence</h2>
<p>It's bizarre how much of a glow things have in December :) but I am glad they do! The week started quietly with a killer gym session,
    where I nearly fell of the treadmill (twice). I responded to some mail and messages and worked on this site. On Tuesday, I entered <em>the zone</em>.
    After a brilliant dance class, I returned to the office to finish the dreaded bug5914.
</p>
<p>
    On the Wednesday, was Johanna's event. A few team members aided with tickets, speaking, etc. I was on the door with Lisa, Sebastian,
    Jonas and Jan, plus some other students. The event was a success and people seemed pretty happy; although, as always, there
    were things we forgot about or didn't think of, so some important lessons were learnt.
</p>
<p>
    Afterwards, I went for a long run to finish listening to a recommended album: "In the Court of the Crimson King". Things got pretty tight
    though as my destination was a train station, and I had to really push it to catch the last train back üòÇ. The train driver was a little
    shocked to see me and so was I when I saw my reflection as I was soaked in sweat.... and BLOOD, as my cheek was gashed on a thorn.    
</p>
<p>
    Not to worry, I had a nice chat with James after :)
</p>
<h2>The bike ride..</h2>
<p>Thursday began like any other, but ended quite unlike any other...
    I merged in some major changes for automating the archive failover at work ready for our team <!--TEAM TEAM TEAM--> meal in the evening!
    Axel and I set off with plenty of time, eager to settle the age-old score by beating the machines with our bicycles!! Unfortunately, 
    whilst my head was protected I couldn't see, for I had forgotten my light. A combination which was in fact more dangerous than Axel's,
    who had all the lights but lacked a helmet. 
</p>
<p>We stuck together though the streets of Walldorf, running all the reds and nearly killing multiple pedestrians, and finally made it
    to the "cover" of the woods, which was terrifying, but we soon emerged onto the main road to the restaurant. But, as we descended a bridge
    I was blinded and had to break heavily, meaning I lost Axel's tailight. I quickly fell further and further behind, until I was riding 
    in the dark :( (sorry Mum). In the distance I could see a red dot and oncoming cars initially seemed a blessing, until I 
    was blinded yet again by them as their lights were at just the <em>wrong</em> height.
</p>
<p>
    Fear not though, as Axel kindly waited for me at the next junction and we rode in together upon our noble steeds (before anyone else, 
    I must add). What followed was a lovely evening full of laughter, chats, plenty of food and many pints of water. On the way back,
    Lisa kindly fashioned a headlight, using my phone and a rag.
</p>
<h2>Eggy bread (sorry for the unpoetic titles)</h2>
<p>To wrap up the week, Mark and I made (you guessed it) Eggy bread and played lots of a card
    game called Cambio, which Emma and Ben taught me back in Southampton. On the Saturday,
    I gave T a ring and went for a jog and in the evening Arne, Niklas, Niklas' sister?, Can, Sebastian,
    Lisa and Arthur made pizzas!!! Beforehand, Arthur taught a few of us Durak and then we all headed to 
    Can and Arne's place. We had a hell of an operation, especially given the tiny kitchen 
    we were working in. Afterwards we watched Forest Gump (with English subtitles), which was brilliant practice for me.
    We didn't finish until 1am üòÇ.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, I went for a jog and had a great catchup call with some of my cousins, filled with many lauhgs.
    In the afternoon, I cycled with Nico to Oberhausen to a Brazilian tapas bar, which had live samba music. Nico's
    parents had driven there and we sat, chat and ate together. The atmosphere was so friendly and Nico even performed with
    the band! Later in the evening, Cian and I had a cracking call and then I went for Yufka-D√∂ner with Lenard and Sofia.
    And then wrapped the weekend up by doing some reading.
</p>
<h2>The final leg</h2>
<p>The week took off at a spring: on Monday evening, I made a pumpkin pie for the office and cooked heavily-marinated chicken
    and spinach burritos with Lenard. We had a rally good laugh making them and there was thoughtful silence as
    we indulged in the final product, occasionally sipping from our cool beers (a generous gift from Karl-Heinz, who accidentally 
    ordered the wrong type of beer üòÇ). I would really recommend serving every meal with these crispy chickpeas üëå
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I had a fabulous <a href="misc/misc.html#dance">dance</a> session, where I caught up with lots of people
    I hadn't seen in a while because the last session was so quiet. Afterwards I cooked
    Spekulatius (a scrumptious cinnamon biscuit) with custard.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I had a nice lunch in the office and tried my hand at being a "rubber duck".. (There's a popular technique
    in programming, where someone talks to a rubber duck to explain their code. By explaining their code aloud, one can often find issues 
    and fix them.) In the evening, I made a curry for Manuel. It almost went completely wrong, when I poured in way too much salt,
    but was able to quickly retrieve it before it was consumed by the sauce. Before this date in history, I lacked the ability to talk and cook 
    was, and that fact remains... Just kidding, I improved massively, which is nice üòÅ I taught him Cambio and then I cycled with him to the
    station, to say goodbye. 
</p>
<p>
    Upon my return I made meringues and practically sat in front of the oven with my fingers crossed that they wouldn't collapse,
    weep, burn or explode (all of which have happened to me before &mdash; except the last ;) ). I was pretty happy with them and on 
    Thursday I made some vegan chocolate mousse for a colleague, which was fun. I also finally learnt Cribbage, which Michael
    kindly taught me. I think it is a little complicated at first and, due to the structure of the game, there is little time for 
    chatting, but I really like it.
</p>
<h2>The big party</h2>
<p>
<!--TODO: CHRISTMAS PARTY-->
</p>
<h2>The last weekend</h2>
<p>On Saturday, James and I had a long call to sort the last gifts and I went for a jog to the traversing wall.
    In the evening, Mark and I went to the Bruchsal Weihnachstmarkt, where we played lots of cards, enjoyed the music 
    and tried the delightful Hungarian Langosh and also a scrummy Bratwurst! We continued our hot chocolate obsession and were
    not disappointed!! This market was cosier but seemed to center entirely around food and drink üòÇ
    We had a nice karaoke session afterwards too.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, Nico and his family, very kindly took me to Stra√übourg, to see the magical Weihnachtsmarkt there. There are four or five separate
    markets on the island there, each with a different atmospheres and themes: some selling hand-crafted gifts, such as these
    wonderful metal figures or decorated marzipan bites, others focussing on food or on drinks. Nico and I went split off together from his parents for a while but we bumped into 
    each other again in a warmer tent. This was one of my favourite markets as the surroundings were stunning and there was a real breadth of 
    stalls. We even had time to go inside the mighty cathedral/dom.
</p>
<h2 class="title-with-caption">Driving home for Christmas (yea)</h2>
<h3 class="title-with-caption">(Although only the first/last 10 minutes were "driving")</h3>
<p>The Monday morning was a little stressful, but I was able to go for a lovely lunch with Can, Arthur, Niklas and Lisa (in Canteen 8!!), 
    which was a lovely penultimate (vorletzte in German) meal. Later in the afternoon, we had a marvellous baby shower for 
    Isa and Chrissy.
</p>
<p>
    In the evening, Lenard and I made pizzas and then Niklas, Arne and Can came round for some rounds of Schwimmen, which was
    hilarious, especially as Can seemed to win every round, without seeming to understand the rules.
    The next day, after a quick team photo, I headed to the train station. On the platform, I peeled and wolfed down my breakfast, lunch and dinner:
    a single boiled egg. I got some odd looks. I then had an uneventful ride and made it to K√∂ln where I boarded my plane and had 
    some lovely games of Cambio, with a lady called Alex, who is a true adventurer! She is always travelling and makes
    sea wildlife documentaries. After landing, I had a nice conversation with a lady, in German, on the bus to Bristol.
</p>
<p>
    After a long day travelling, I arrived at Will's place and chatted with Will until 3am. I then fell asleep. The next day,
    we played some games and went exploring the Bristol christmas market. We had a great catchup and sampled 
    lots of cheese üòÇ I then caught the train back and went to see a panto with Adam, Mel, Chloe and Sophie.
    It was pretty entertaining and included some sketches I hadn't seen in a while, such as the Boxer, Joker, Policeofficer, 
    chef sketch, where various props come dangerously close to vital organs. But, Sleeping Beauty struggled
    , in some ways, to be converted to a pantomime. 
</p>
<h2 class="title-with-caption">The holidays</h2>
<h3 class="title-with-caption">A whistlestop tour</h3>
<p>I worked for the last days of the week and had a catchup with the Puris (sadly minus Kieran). We mainly
    chatted and it was great to hear, after such a long time, how they were all doing. Cian and Jon came round on the Friday: 
    we played some games and made a cocktail, and then we headed out. Whilst "out", we bumped into Thea and Finola, as well as Carter,
    Jayden, Matty and Bogdan. We stayed in Mckenzies for a while and then headed to the Vic (where we bumped into Oscar and Jacob!). 
    We all had a really great catch up and were introduced/reintroduced to some of Finola's friends. A cracking evening!
</p>
<p>Over the weekend, T, James and I went for a great mince pie and hot chocolate and we all decorated the tree.
    I went for some of the best wings ever with Tom, where there were some great DJs playing too. 
    Cian and I went for a great run and chat and then I got stuck in helping with jobs.
</p>
<p>The Christmas holidays themselves were lovely and I had a fabulous time. We all played lots of games, 
    had fun cooking (as well as being cooked for), chatted, went walking and laughed a lot. I went on a few nice runs too 
    and throughout the holidays felt extremely warm and very happy. Thanks to all those who made it so special. 
</p>
<h2>Inbetween years (as they say in German)</h2>
<p>I met Tom for a cold walk and a warm coffee (Tom knows all the spots); played a fair bit of Crib, with Mum; watched 
    <em>Sixth Sense</em> and <em>They Cloned Tyrone</em> (both brilliant!); made Gumbo with Mum, which took agggges; and watched 
    an exciting Forest game in the pub.
</p>
<h2>New Years</h2>
<p>On the 31st, we had a great afternoon with the Reading Bazeley's,
    playing Charades, Throw Throw Burrito (just as wacky and brilliant as it sounds) and this charming Sumo Squats game.
    After they headed off, we had a tidy up and then Granny and Grandad came back round for some games of Hearts and to consume the Gumbo.
</p>
<p>Then Jon and I headed to McKenzies, where we immediately saw Tyler, his partner, Alex and Sam, as well as the usual suspects behind the bar (Carter), plus Maia.
    We stayed for a while in the buzzing atmosphere, before departing for Tree, but we had no tickets so instead turned 180&deg; and headed to Longs, where we tried various
    frightfully tasty cocktails: Russian Spy (basically a milkshake) and Cosmopolitan (Cranberry and Orange). Tyler and Meg headed home, whilst 
    Sam, Jon and I went to the Vic, where the backroom had this legendary trance DJ. We bumped into some familiar faces including Ben, Finn and Hannah. 
    Then we walked around a bit, bumping into Kieren, before having a lovely chat with Luca and Joe, on the pavement opposite Dominos, for over an hour. Then we all walked home together.
    A fantastic New Years!
</p>
<p>The 1st was quiet day: we finished a movie and played lots of cards. On the 2nd, I worked and then flew back to Germany,
    staying the night in a youth hostel. Unfortunately, my fear of missing the 7am train meant that I barely slept. I eventually decided to take the
    5:30am train and I actually made it into the office at 10am! That was a tough day, but I was back and eager to take on 
    January...
