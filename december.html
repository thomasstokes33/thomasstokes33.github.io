<h1>Delightful Dezember!</h1>
<p>In the first week of December, I ate a lot of cabbage.. spicy cabbage, balsamic cabbage, spinach+onion (with cabbage), braised
    sweet cabbage, cabbage curry and cabbage soup (this was actually the first). The week was tough from a work perspective but 
    also engaging (especially when we put on Christmas music). However, I felt like I deserved the Friday night GlÃ¼hwein: after work, Lisa and I rushed around trying to catch the first
    bus, and accidentally took a roundabout, but certainly adventurous, route (via the train station ðŸ˜‚). We rendezvoused at the local 
    Weihnachtsmarkt, which was well stocked with crafty gifts, delectable food, warm drinks. There was a wonderful choir and hearty fire.     
</p>
<p> On the Saturday, I started work, with James, on some gifts, had a walk and went to <strong>yet again</strong> a Weihnachtsmarkt, 
    this time with the student community, to Heidelberg. I met some wonderful folks, as well as chatting more to Mark, and enjoyed the Christmas spectacle.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, I awoke and headed to the Christmas market. Just kidding ;) (that comes later.) I did some exercise and had a good family catchup
    And then I headed to the Christmas market with Lenard, Lisa, Sebastian, Can and Niklas (whom we baked cookied/PlÃ¤tzchen with). We were joined
    by Lenard and his partner Sofia. I later headed to play tennis (to warm up), with Karl-Heinz, Petra and Jula. Luckily, we moved to indoor courts,
    as opposed to the outdoor clay pitches, we had previously played on. We had some brilliant sets! An unusual, fun and fit way to end 
    the week.

<h2>Christmas tunes commence</h2>
<p>It's bizarre how much of a glow things have in December :) but I am glad they do! The week started quietly with a killer gym session,
    where I nearly fell of the treadmill (twice). I responded to some mail and messages and worked on this site. On Tuesday, I entered <em>the zone</em>.
    After a brilliant dance class, I returned to the office to finish the dreaded bug5914.
</p>
<p>
    On the Wednesday, was Johanna's event. A few team members aided with tickets, speaking, etc. I was on the door with Lisa, Sebastian,
    Jonas and Jan, plus some other students. The event was a success and people seemed pretty happy; although, as always, there
    were things we forgot about or didn't think of, so some important lessons were learnt.
</p>
<p>
    Afterwards, I went for a long run to finish listening to a recommended album: "In the Court of the Crimson King". Things got pretty tight
    though as my destination was a train station, and I had to really push it to catch the last train back ðŸ˜‚. The train driver was a little
    shocked to see me and so was I when I saw my reflection as I was soaked in sweat.... and BLOOD, as my cheek was gashed on a thorn.    
</p>
<p>
    Not to worry, I had a nice chat with James after :)
</p>
<h2>The bike ride..</h2>
<p>Thursday began like any other, but ended quite unlike any other...
    I merged in some major changes for automating the archive failover at work ready for our team <!--TEAM TEAM TEAM--> meal in the evening!
    Axel and I set off with plenty of time, eager to settle the age-old score by beating the machines with our bicycles!! Unfortunately, 
    whilst my head was protected I couldn't see, for I had forgotten my light. A combination which was in fact more dangerous than Axel's,
    who had all the lights but lacked a helmet. 
</p>
<p>We stuck together though the streets of Walldorf, running all the reds and nearly killing multiple pedestrians, and finally made it
    to the "cover" of the woods, which was terrifying, but we soon emerged onto the main road to the restaurant. But, as we descended a bridge
    I was blinded and had to break heavily, meaning I lost Axel's tailight. I quickly fell further and further behind, until I was riding 
    in the dark :( (sorry Mum). In the distance I could see a red dot and oncoming cars initially seemed a blessing, until I 
    was blinded yet again by them as their lights were at just the <em>wrong</em> height.
</p>
<p>
    Fear not though, as Axel kindly waited for me at the next junction and we rode in together upon our noble steeds (before anyone else, 
    I must add). What followed was a lovely evening full of laughter, chats, plenty of food and many pints of water. On the way back,
    Lisa kindly fashioned a headlight, using my phone and a rag.
</p>
<h2>Eggy bread (sorry for the unpoetic titles)</h2>
<p>To wrap up the week, Mark and I made (you guessed it) Eggy bread and played lots of a card
    game called Cambio, which Emma and Ben taught me back in Southampton. On the Saturday,
    I gave T a ring and went for a jog and in the evening Arne, Niklas, Niklas' sister?, Can, Sebastian,
    Lisa and Arthur made pizzas!!! Beforehand, Arthur taught a few of us Durak and then we all headed to 
    Can and Arne's place. We had a hell of an operation, especially given the tiny kitchen 
    we were working in. Afterwards we watched Forest Gump (with English subtitles), which was brilliant practice for me.
    We didn't finish until 1am ðŸ˜‚.
