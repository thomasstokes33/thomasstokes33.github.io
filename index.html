        <p>Hi, My name is Thomas (as you may have gathered). I am currently doing a placement year in southern Germany,
            working for a software firm, to help work on sailing analytics software, that has been used by race teams
            and spectators, since 2011 for small and large regattas alike, including the legendary annual Kieler Woche 
            (in Kiel). Next year,the software will also be deployed at the olympics of the beautiful coast of
            Marseilles.
        </p>
        <p>   
            However, until then I will be working hard, exploring the surroundings, learning German and 
            partying: this website aims to be a brief documentation of my travels and learnings. I hope you enjoy reading
            and feel free to contact me about any mistakes, suggestions or inaccuracies. Thanks :)
        </p>
