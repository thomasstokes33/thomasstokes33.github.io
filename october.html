    <h1>Octokober Antics</h1>
    <h2>Week beginning 2nd October</h2>
    <p>I went to this political discussion group (in English, but German before and after), and the chosen topic by
        Alyssa,
        a professor from Columbia university, was Kamala Harris. I would come to attend these sessions most weeks and
        were always insightful, due to the breadth of opinions and well chosen and crafted sessions. I really enjoyed
        taking a backseast,
        even afterwards, when we visited a local bar for a drink. </p>
    <p>
        On Tuesday 3rd October, it was a Feiertag (national holiday), namely reunification day: on this day in 1990, the
        German
        Democratic Republic (East) joined with the Federal Republic of Germany (West). This date marks the offical
        completion of
        the reunification. I was informed of alternative suggested date for this Feiertag: the 9th November. On this
        date in 1989,
        the Berlin wall came down and it coincided with the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919">Proclamation of Germany</a>, in
        1918, and the defeat of the Hitler's Munich Putsch
        , in 1923. However, this date is not celebrated because, on this day in 1938, was the <a
            href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>, a horrific pogrom
        against
        Jews.
    </p>
    <p>I spent some time researching and reflecting these events and also visited the nearby Schloss, called
        Schwetzingen.</p>

    <p>
        It's a wonderful palace, with sprawling gardens, containing numerous "smaller" houses and sculptures.

    <p> In the evening, I attended <a href="misc/misc.html#dance">dance</a>.</p>
    <p class="fun-fact"><em>Fun fact: </em>Pygmy goats have a sort of accent: young goats, who are raised together, have
        a similar calling.
        Goats' milk is easy to digest and is used more globally than cows' milk. Finally, goats rarely cause overgrazing
        issues.

    <p>On Wednesday, Linus, Axel's son, gave me an excellent tour of the fire station and aftwerwards I had a drink with
        Moritz and Leon. On Thursday, I attended a drill and later had drinks with Petra and Karl-Heinz (my landlady and
        landlord).
    </p>
    <p>Over the weekend, I had a visit from my parents. My boss kindly booked us a table at the local tapas bar <em>La
            Torgua</em>!
        We had a delightful meal, plus some free Hugo :) On Saturday, I showed M&D the sights of Heidelberg, such as the
        mighty Schloss,
        Philosphie Weg, Gelato Go, the Alt-BrÃ¼cke (old bridge) and the Apotheke museum (found within the schloss
        courtyard). And of course,
        the really big barrel, only outsized by the Bad DÃ¼rkheim Fass &mdash; which contains a restaurant! Instead of
        lunch at one place,
        we shared three dishes, each one from a different place: currywurst, tabbouleh salad and some really good
        lemonade.
    </p>
    <p>In the evening, we went to the Schnitzelhaus, where you could choose from at least 15 different sauces and styles
        , and we had the same smiley waitress from my visit there on my first day.</p>
    <p>On the Sunday, we visited the Botanical Gardens and then headed to DÃ¶napolis for a quick bite before we said our
        goodbyes :(
        In the evening, I played tennis with Karl-Heinz and he gave me some serving tips.
    </p>
    <h2>Work hard; play hard</h2>
    <p>
        On Monday, I finished slightly early and played tennis with Karl-Heinz and his sister: first I practiced my
        service but
        then we played together, rotating who was alone. Thanks for including me :) I seemed to struggle playing
        doubles, perhaps
        because I put extra pressure on myself to not "let down" my team mate or, perhaps, I relaxed too much, feeling
        false
        security in having someone beside me, to "help out" ðŸ˜‚ Es hat sehr viel spaÃŸ gemacht (it was very fun)! I then
        worked
        late on the leaderboard class diagrams.

    <p class="fun-fact"><em>Fun fact(s):</em> The Eland can travel for 50km a day in search of food! They can survive long periods
        without drinking, extracting the necessary water from their food. Finally, their legs make a clicking noise, because they have 
        a knee tendon, which twangs against bone (the sound of this "twang" indicates fitness and size).
